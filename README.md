Welcome to Samuelo's code! If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave them in the Issues tab. 

The majority of you visiting here will be most interested in the commands and events folders. They can both be found in the src folder.
The commands folder holds the code for slash commands (i.e. /research), and the events folder holds the code for Samuelo's responses to regular messages.
